# Welcome to my Filtering Sorting & Pagination Basic Application

## This is a little bit about my application and what I wanted to accomplish with it!

    Trying to learn functional components and the way they can be used with React.JS is one of a few goals here.

    The next step is to utilize React Hooks, with also having methods and objects built out. Calling on them through state and props objects. This allows me to utilize both props being passed to the component kind of like a functional component. And, state which I will use within a companent as a sort of variable decleration.
