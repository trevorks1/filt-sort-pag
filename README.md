# Welcome to my Filtering Sorting & Pagination Basic Application

This application will rely entirely on the Front-End approach. A simple e-commerce application allowing to sort alphabetically and by price then apply other filters such as a color and brand.

## Dependencies

- React
- Redux
- Bulma: For styling purposes but we can use anything we would like.
- ES6 functions such as sort, filter, and find.

## This application is fairly basic and a read only state. Must make changes with pure functions
